# wine_quality_regression

Final Project for MAT3375 - Regression Analysis. 

The Wine Quality dataset was chosen from Kaggle. This dataset describes how much citric acid, residual sugar is in each wine as well as its pH, density, achohol level and the quality (based on a scale from 1 to 10). We created a model to predict the quality of wine using multiple linear regression and validated the model.
